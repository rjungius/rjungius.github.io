Finally we can really draw some conclusions. Let's seeâ€¦

[ Plot/Results of t-test after matching ]

There is no significance?! As we always say, no results are results. After performing matching we were able to balance the dataset so the results obtained were more trustful, and they show no significance, even if before it appeared to be. This shows that what can be perceived in a well named naive analysis is not a picture of reality but further analysis is needed.

Of course we still have to take into account that our work may not be perfect, in observational studies there are observed and unobserved covariates and their consideration (or not) can shift the results completely. We have mentioned above other confounders that were not taken into account in this study but even further analysis could be done on unobserved covariates like sensitivity analysis. What we intend to say with this final comment is that we should always be skeptical about our results and not take them for granted.
