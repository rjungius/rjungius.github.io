Of course we still have to take into account that our work may not be perfect, in observational studies there are observed and unobserved covariates and their consideration (or not) can shift the results completely. We have mentioned above other confounders that were not taken into account in this study but even further analysis could be done on unobserved covariates like sensitivity analysis. What we intend to say with this final comment is that we should always be skeptical about our results and not take them for granted.
