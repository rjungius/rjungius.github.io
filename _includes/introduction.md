Disparities between global regions have been evident in various aspects, and knowledge distribution is no exception. Wikipedia shows a significant concentration of articles tagged in Europe and North America, overshadowing contributions from less developed regions <sup><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">[1]</a></sup>. This reflects social and cultural imbalances among different geographical areas. Research by Laniado and Rib√© <sup><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">[2]</a></sup> reveals that Wikipedia editors tend to focus on articles related to their cultural identity, which was further explored in <sup><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">[3]</a></sup>. Our project aims to investigate if this inequality is present in the Wikipedia excerpt <sup><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">[4]</a></sup> used in the Wikispeedia game. We want to determine if players fare better when navigating through articles related to Europe, highlighting potential geographic bias.
