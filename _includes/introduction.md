Disparities between global regions have been evident in various aspects, and knowledge distribution is no exception. Wikipedia shows a significant concentration of articles tagged in Europe and North America, overshadowing contributions from less developed regions <a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">[1]</a>. This reflects social and cultural imbalances among different geographical areas. Research by Laniado and Rib√© <a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">[2]</a> reveals that Wikipedia editors tend to focus on articles related to their cultural identity, which was further explored in <a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">[3]</a>. Our project aims to investigate if this inequality is present in the Wikipedia excerpt <a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">[4]</a> used in the Wikispeedia game. We want to determine if players fare better when navigating through articles related to Europe, highlighting potential geographic bias.
