We still need to dive deeper and we are getting a feeling that this is in fact an observational study, therefore, we define a treatment and control group. The treatment group will be the paths taken by the users that have a target article classified in Europe and the control group will be those paths whose target article is not classified in Europe, in other words, the rest. 

Lets compare the paths followed by players, we want to analyze the success rate. For this, we will define four main variables based on their Spearman correlation coefficient to whether the game is finished or not:

* Start length of the article, as the count of words.
* Target length of the article, as the count of words.
* Start articles PageRank
* Target articles PageRank
* Shortest path to target, as the lowest number of articles needed to get to the target.
